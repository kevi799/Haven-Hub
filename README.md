# Houses Management App

This is a simple React application that allows you to view, search, update the status, and delete houses. The app is designed to manage a list of available houses, with the ability to mark them as "sold" or "available". Users can also filter the list by house title or location.

## Features

- **View Houses**: Display a list of available houses with relevant details (title, location, price, status, and images).
- **Search Houses**: Filter houses by title or location.
- **Update Status**: Mark houses as "available" or "sold".
- **Delete Houses**: Delete a house from the list.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **JSON API**: A mock API endpoint for fetching and managing house data.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/houses-management-app.git
   cd houses-management-app
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**:
   `npm install`
3. **npm install**
   `npm start```

## API Mock Setup:##

Ensure you have a mock backend server running at http://localhost:3000 to provide house data.
The mock server should serve endpoints like:
GET /houses: Fetch all houses
PATCH /houses/:id: Update house status
DELETE /houses/:id: Delete a house
